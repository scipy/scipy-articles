\section*{Key technical improvements}

Here we describe key technical improvements made in the last three years.

\subsection*{Data structures}
\textbf{cKDTree}
\input{ckdtree}
\textbf{Sparse matrices}

\subsection*{Unified bindings to compiled code}
\subsubsection*{LowLevelCallable}
As of SciPy version 0.19, it is possible for users to wrap low-level
functions in a \texttt{scipy.LowLevelCallable()} object that reduces
the overhead for calling compiled C functions directly from Python.
Supported low-level functions include \texttt{PyCapsule} objects,
ctypes function pointers, and cffi function pointers. The low level
function signature must be consistent with the expectations of the
routine it is passed to. For example, the documentation for
\texttt{scipy.ndimage.generic\_filter} defines two acceptable C callback
function signatures that may be used to produce functions that operate
on each element of image data with low overhead. The C code may be
generated using numba or Cython, for example, as long as the function
call signature matches the specifications. Furthermore, it is even
possible to generate a low-level callback function automatically
from a Cython module using \texttt{scipy.LowLevelCallable.from\_cython}.

\subsection*{Cython bindings for BLAS, LAPACK and special}

\subsection*{Test and benchmark suite}

    \subsubsection*{Benchmark suite}

    The airspeed velocity (asv) library enables benchmarking Python packages over their lifetimes, and the performance of the SciPy
    code base was monitored with asv starting in February of 2015 (PR \#4501). In addition to ensuring that unit tests are passing (see above),
    confirming that performance generally remains constant or improves over the commit hash history of the project allows us to objectively
    measure that our code base is improving, to empower scientific applications.

    Consider the asv benchmark results shown in Figure~\ref{fig:asvbench}, spanning roughly nine years of project history. These demonstrate the gradual performance
    improvements in a nearest-neighbor search through \texttt{scipy.spatial.cKDTree.query()}, and can be run using the command:


    \texttt{python run.py run -e -s 800 --bench "\textbackslash btime\_query\textbackslash b" "02de46a546..b3ddb2c"}

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{static/asv_time_query_ckdtree}
        \caption{Airspeed velocity benchmarks for scipy.spatial.cKDTree.query() over a roughly nine year commit history time frame. The results are based on Python 2.7 performance on the master branch of the project using numpy 1.8.2 and Cython versions 0.27.3, 0.21.1, and 0.18 (for improved backward compatibility). Only the L2 (Euclidean) norm is shown here, and to improve backward compatibility and sampling of the benchmarks there was no application of toroidal topology to the KDTree (boxsize argument was ignored).}
        \label{fig:asvbench}
    \end{figure}

   Any pull request can be compared against the \texttt{master} branch with the command \texttt{asv continuous master new-feature}. This will provide a benchmark against the master branch and the branch a new feature is implemented in. More features are available in the documentation, including arguments to select which benchmarks to run.

    \subsubsection*{Test suite}
    The SciPy test suite is orchestrated by a continuous integration matrix
    that includes posix and Windows (32/64-bit) platforms managed by Travis CI and appveyor,
    respectively. Our tests cover Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and include
    code linting with pyflakes and pycodestyle. There are more than $13000$ unit
    tests in the test suite, which is written for usage with the pytest runner, and
    with a 76.5 \% coverage of approximately $204000$ lines
    of code. Documentation for the code is automatically built and hosted by the
    CircleCI service to facilitate evaluation of documentation changes / integrity.
    Our full test suite also passes with PyPy3, a just-in-time compiled version
    of the Python language.

\section*{Project organisation and community}

\textbf{Governance}

SciPy adopted an official Governance Document on August 3,
2017\cite{SciPyProjectGovernance}.
We have a Benevolant Dictator for Life (BDFL), Pauli Virtanen, leading the
project, following a detailed discussion of the governance model with the
community on the mailing list.  In practice, the overruling authority of the BDFL
is anticipated to be used only when the Steering Council cannot agree on a matter.
The BDFL is expected to consider any strong indications that they should step down;
although the BDFL may appoint a successor it is generally expected that the Steering
Council will be consulted on the matter.

The (currently) 18 member Steering Council is chaired by Ralf Gommers and performs a number of
tasks including nominating and voting on new Council Members, and actively
contributing to the progress of the project (could be code review but also
outreach activities, etc.). Generally, 1 year of sustained and substantial
contributions (not restricted to source code contributions) that improve
the project are the prerequiste for nomination of new Council Members. Council
Members do not get special treatment for the vast majority of the day to day
project activities (code submission / review), though it is anticipated that their
experience with the project will serve as helpful guidance in many matters.
Council Members have commit rights to the project, but will typically only
incorporate changes when there are no substantive community objections. The
Chair of the Steering Council is responsible for starting more formal
technical reviews of the direction of the project, ensuring that the
composition of the Council remains current, and communicating / summarizing
any Council activities performed privately to the broader community. We also
describe in some detail how institutional partners may contribute to the
project, but no financial weight from grants or other sources
may be leveraged to circumvent or overrule the technical direction of the
project decided upon by the Steering Committee. The Chair does not have
a fixed term, but is nominated by the Steering Committee and is expected
to yield to substantive claims that stepping down is the appropriate action.

SciPy adopted an official Code of Conduct on October 24, 2017
\cite{SciPyCodeOfConduct}, drawing
inspiration from the Apache Foundation Code of
Conduct\cite{ApacheCodeOfConduct}, the Contributor Covenant
\cite{ContributorConvenant},
the Jupyter Code of Conduct \cite{Jupyter_COC}, and the Open Source Guides -
Code of Conduct\cite{OSG_COC}. In short,
we stated five specific guidelines: \emph{be open} (to anyone participating in our community),
\emph{be empathetic and patient} (in resolving conflicts), \emph{be collaborative} (we depend
on each other to build up the tools in the library), \emph{be inquisitive} (identifying issues
early on can be helpful to everyone), and \emph{be careful with wording} (do not harass or exclude).
We outlined a broad diversity inclusion statement, and provide
instructions for contacting the three members of our Code of Conduct Committee or an
external representative on the NumFOCUS Board of Directors.

\section*{Discussion}

\textit{The Discussion should be succinct and must not contain subheadings.}

\textbf{Impact now}
SciPy has a strong developer community and a massive user base. GitHub
traffic metrics report roughly 20,000 unique visitors to the source
website between May 14 and May 27, 2018, with 721 unique copies (``clones")
of the code base over that roughly two-week period. The developer community
consists of 610 unique contributors of source code, with $>19,000$ commits
accepted into the code base (GitHub page data).

From the user side, there have been at least 15 million downloads
of the SciPy manylinux wheels between the start of 2016 and May of 2018
(njs blog). The recommended manuscript for citing SciPy,
published online 17 years ago, has been cited $>3000$
times. Some of the most prominent citing articles include the IPython
publication, a heavily-cited Nature Biotechnology article, a dark
matter annihlitation study in the field of cosmology, and many of the
other major downstream software libraries in the Python scientific
computing stack.

\textbf{Future development}.
\textit{This section should include key issues: sparse arrays, ndimage pixel vs point, splines, fftpack vs. np.fft and linalg vs. np.linalg, under-maintained submodules.}

\subsection*{ndimage pixel vs point}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A pixel is not a little square
    (http://alvyray.com/Memos/CG/Microsoft/6\_pixel.pdf)
  \item Match edges vs match centers
    (http://entropymine.com/imageworsener/matching/)
\end{itemize}

There are two competing models for representing image measurements:
the first considers an image as a collection of pixels, square blocks
of size 1x1 with centers offset by (0.5, 0.5).  This model corresponds
closely with a camera sensor, that integrates light as it falls on
(more-or-less) square elements, producing a digital readout for each.

Another view is that of an image as a grid of point measurements.
This model explicitly rejects two notions encouraged by the pixel
model: that our signal is best represented as a step-wise function, and
that a single measurement represents knowledge of the surrounding
square area element.  Instead, we think of the image as a smoothly
varying function, of which we have measurements at grid positions.

While the representations may not seem very different, they have
significant implications for image processing algorithms such as
rescaling.

{\tt ndimage} currently follows the pixel model for operations like
{\tt zoom} but the data point model for general geometric
transformations and interpolation.  We think that consistently using
the data point model will serve us better in the long run:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item It makes no assumption about the sampling mechanism used
    (camera, scanner, laser, etc.).
  \item NumPy coordinates map directly to measurement coordinates,
    without a 0.5 offset. \todo{Will have to rethink this statement,
      since this {\bf is} the current underlying model for interpolation}
  \item It makes it easier to reason about extrapolation.  E.g., the current
    dubious notion of ``reflection'', in which the image is padded
    {\tt d c b a | a b c d | d c b a} becomes nonsensical, and leaves
    only the reliable notion of mirroring, {\tt d c b | a b c d | c b a}.
\end{enumerate}

The second model, while consistent, does introduce some challenges
w.r.t. traditional image manipulation (see attached figure).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{static/image_pixel_model}
    \caption{Upscaling an image 2x.  In the data point model, the
      original data points remain in the image corners, which means it
      contributes less to the center of the resulting image than to
      the corners.  In the pixel model, the original pixels contribute
      more evenly to both of these.}
