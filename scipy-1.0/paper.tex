\begin{abstract}
SciPy is an open source scientific computing library for the Python programming language.
SciPy 1.0 was released in late 2017, about 16 years after the original
version 0.1 release. SciPy
has become a \emph{de facto} standard for leveraging scientific algorithms
in the Python programming language, with more than 600
unique code contributors, millions of downloads per year, 161 dependent
packages, and 28700 dependent respositories.
The library includes functionality spanning clustering, Fourier transforms,
integration, interpolation, file I/O, linear algebra, image processing,
orthogonal distance regression, minimization algorithms, signal processing,
sparse matrix handling, computational geometry, and statistics. In this
work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of the
SciPy library and highlight some recent technical developments.

\section*{Architecture and implementation choices}

\subsection*{Submodule organisation}

\subsection*{Common infrastructure}

\subsection*{Language choices}
Python, Cython, Fortran, C and C++ are the programming languages
used to implement scientific algorithms in the SciPy library. An analysis
of our code base using the \texttt{linguist} library provides a detailed
breakdown as \% composition by programming language in SciPy
(Figure~\ref{fig:linguist}).

        \label{fig:linguist}
    \end{figure}

For implementing new functionality, we have a clear order of language preference.
First Python, if performance is not an issue. If it is, then in order of
preference: Cython, C, C++, Fortran. The main motivation for this is 
maintainability: Cython has the highest abstraction level and most 
Python developers will understand it. C is also widely known,
and easier to deal with for the core development team
than C++ and especially Fortran.

While it is not surprising that Python is heavily used in SciPy, the
usage distribution of the other languages warrants some discussion. Fortran
is an extremely well-established scientific programming language, both
for historical reasons and because of its continued excellent
performance\cite{Koelbel:1993:HPF:562354}. We
wrap the FFTPACK Fortran library for performing Fourier
transforms\cite{SWARZTRAUBER198445, SWARZTRAUBER198251} since
this library has been a standard in the field for 33 years and has a license
that is compatible with our own. Likewise, we wrap the Fortran source
for ODEPACK\cite{citeulike:2644528} as it has been  trusted for the initial 
value problem for ordinary differential equation systems for 30 years. For
similar reasons we also wrap the Fortran libraries QUADPACK\cite{1983qspa.book.....P} (for numerical
integration of one-dimensional functions), FITPACK\cite{Dierckx:1993:CSF:151103} (curve-fitting /
interpolation), ODRPACK\cite{ODRPACK_Boggs} (orthogonal distance regression),
MINPACK\cite{osti_6997568} (minimization of linear and nonlinear equations),
ARPACK\cite{leh:sor:yan96} (solving large scale eigenvalue problems), 
ALGORITHM 644\cite{Amos:1986:APP:7921.214331} (handling Bessel Functions), and 
CDFLIB\cite{CDFLIB_site} (evaluation of cumulative density functions).

Rounding out the top three languages in SciPy is C, which is also extremely
well-established over several decades\cite{Kernighan:1988:CPL:576122} of
scientific computing. Alongside its objected-oriented relative C++, C
can be leveraged in Python after being exposed using the Cython
language. Cython has been described as a creole language that mixes
the best parts of Python and lower-level C / C++
paradigms\cite{behnel2011cython}. We thus often use Cython as a glue
between well-established low-level scientific computing libraries and
the Python interface offered by SciPy. We also use Cython to enable
performance enhancements in Python code, especially for cases where heavily
used inner loops benefit from a compiled code with static typing. Some of the C
libraries that we wrap in SciPy include trlib\cite{doi:10.1080/10556788.2018.1449842} 
(iterative solving of the trust region problem), SuperLU\cite{li05,superlu_ug99} (solution of
large, sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations),
Qhull\cite{Barber:1996:QAC:235815.235821} (computational
geometry), and Cephes\cite{cephes_netlib} (mathematics algorithms). 

Therefore, the relative abundance of different programming languages
in the SciPy library results from a combination of the usage of powerful performance
enhancing languages that interact well with Python (i.e., Cython), and
the usage of languages (and their libraries) that have proven reliable
and performant over many decades. The position that SciPy occupies
near the foundation of the scientific Python ecosystem is such that
adoption of new languages or major dependencies is generally unlikely--our
choices are strongly driven by long-term stability. GPU acceleration,
new transpiling libraries, and the latest JIT compilation approaches
(i.e., Numba\cite{Lam:2015:NLP:2833157.2833162}) are very powerful, but currently fall outside the remit
of the main SciPy library. That said, we have recently increased our
efforts to support compatibility with some of these options, and having
our full test suite pass with the PyPy JIT compiler\cite{Bolz:2009:TMP:1565824.1565827}
is now a requirement in our development workflow.

\subsection*{API and ABI evolution}


\section*{Key technical improvements}

Here we describe key technical improvements made in the last three years.

\subsection*{Data structures}
\textbf{cKDTree}
\input{ckdtree}
\textbf{Sparse matrices}

\subsection*{Unified bindings to compiled code}
\subsubsection*{LowLevelCallable}
As of SciPy version 0.19, it is possible for users to wrap low-level
functions in a \texttt{scipy.LowLevelCallable()} object that reduces
the overhead for calling compiled C functions directly from Python.
Supported low-level functions include \texttt{PyCapsule} objects,
ctypes function pointers, and cffi function pointers. The low level
function signature must be consistent with the expectations of the
routine it is passed to. For example, the documentation for
\texttt{scipy.ndimage.generic\_filter} defines two acceptable C callback
function signatures that may be used to produce functions that operate
on each element of image data with low overhead. The C code may be
generated using numba or Cython, for example, as long as the function
call signature matches the specifications. Furthermore, it is even
possible to generate a low-level callback function automatically
from a Cython module using \texttt{scipy.LowLevelCallable.from\_cython}.

\subsection*{Cython bindings for BLAS, LAPACK and special}

\subsection*{Numerical optimization}
\input{scipy-optimize}


\subsection*{Statistical distributions}

\subsection*{Polynomial interpolators}

\subsection*{Test and benchmark suite}

    \subsubsection*{Benchmark suite}

    The airspeed velocity (asv) library enables benchmarking Python packages over their lifetimes, and the performance of the SciPy
    code base was monitored with asv starting in February of 2015 (PR \#4501). In addition to ensuring that unit tests are passing (see above),
    confirming that performance generally remains constant or improves over the commit hash history of the project allows us to objectively
    measure that our code base is improving, to empower scientific applications.

    Consider the asv benchmark results shown in Figure~\ref{fig:asvbench}, spanning roughly nine years of project history. These demonstrate the gradual performance
    improvements in a nearest-neighbor search through \texttt{scipy.spatial.cKDTree.query()}, and can be run using the command:


    \texttt{python run.py run -e -s 800 --bench "\textbackslash btime\_query\textbackslash b" "02de46a546..b3ddb2c"}

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{static/asv_time_query_ckdtree}
        \caption{Airspeed velocity benchmarks for scipy.spatial.cKDTree.query() over a roughly nine year commit history time frame. The results are based on Python 2.7 performance on the master branch of the project using numpy 1.8.2 and Cython versions 0.27.3, 0.21.1, and 0.18 (for improved backward compatibility). Only the L2 (Euclidean) norm is shown here, and to improve backward compatibility and sampling of the benchmarks there was no application of toroidal topology to the KDTree (boxsize argument was ignored).}
        \label{fig:asvbench}
    \end{figure}

   Any pull request can be compared against the \texttt{master} branch with the command \texttt{asv continuous master new-feature}. This will provide a benchmark against the master branch and the branch a new feature is implemented in. More features are available in the documentation, including arguments to select which benchmarks to run.

    \subsubsection*{Test suite}
    The SciPy test suite is orchestrated by a continuous integration matrix
    that includes posix and Windows (32/64-bit) platforms managed by Travis CI and appveyor,
    respectively. Our tests cover Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and include
    code linting with pyflakes and pycodestyle. There are more than $13000$ unit
    tests in the test suite, which is written for usage with the pytest runner, and
    with a 76.5 \% coverage of approximately $204000$ lines
    of code. Documentation for the code is automatically built and hosted by the
    CircleCI service to facilitate evaluation of documentation changes / integrity.
    Our full test suite also passes with PyPy3, a just-in-time compiled version
    of the Python language.

\section*{Project organisation and community}

\textbf{Governance}

SciPy adopted an official Governance Document on August 3,
2017\cite{SciPyProjectGovernance}.
We have a Benevolant Dictator for Life (BDFL), Pauli Virtanen, leading the
project, following a detailed discussion of the governance model with the
community on the mailing list.  In practice, the overruling authority of the BDFL
is anticipated to be used only when the Steering Council cannot agree on a matter.
The BDFL is expected to consider any strong indications that they should step down;
although the BDFL may appoint a successor it is generally expected that the Steering
Council will be consulted on the matter.

The (currently) 18 member Steering Council is chaired by Ralf Gommers and performs a number of
tasks including nominating and voting on new Council Members, and actively
contributing to the progress of the project (could be code review but also
outreach activities, etc.). Generally, 1 year of sustained and substantial
contributions (not restricted to source code contributions) that improve
the project are the prerequiste for nomination of new Council Members. Council
Members do not get special treatment for the vast majority of the day to day
project activities (code submission / review), though it is anticipated that their
experience with the project will serve as helpful guidance in many matters.
Council Members have commit rights to the project, but will typically only
incorporate changes when there are no substantive community objections. The
Chair of the Steering Council is responsible for starting more formal
technical reviews of the direction of the project, ensuring that the
composition of the Council remains current, and communicating / summarizing
any Council activities performed privately to the broader community. We also
describe in some detail how institutional partners may contribute to the
project, but no financial weight from grants or other sources
may be leveraged to circumvent or overrule the technical direction of the
project decided upon by the Steering Committee. The Chair does not have
a fixed term, but is nominated by the Steering Committee and is expected
to yield to substantive claims that stepping down is the appropriate action.

SciPy adopted an official Code of Conduct on October 24, 2017
\cite{SciPyCodeOfConduct}, drawing
inspiration from the Apache Foundation Code of
Conduct\cite{ApacheCodeOfConduct}, the Contributor Covenant
\cite{ContributorConvenant},
the Jupyter Code of Conduct \cite{Jupyter_COC}, and the Open Source Guides -
Code of Conduct\cite{OSG_COC}. In short,
we stated five specific guidelines: \emph{be open} (to anyone participating in our community),
\emph{be empathetic and patient} (in resolving conflicts), \emph{be collaborative} (we depend
on each other to build up the tools in the library), \emph{be inquisitive} (identifying issues
early on can be helpful to everyone), and \emph{be careful with wording} (do not harass or exclude).
We outlined a broad diversity inclusion statement, and provide
instructions for contacting the three members of our Code of Conduct Committee or an
external representative on the NumFOCUS Board of Directors.

\section*{Discussion}

\textit{The Discussion should be succinct and must not contain subheadings.}

\textbf{Impact now}
SciPy has a strong developer community and a massive user base. GitHub
traffic metrics report roughly 20,000 unique visitors to the source
website between May 14 and May 27, 2018, with 721 unique copies (``clones")
of the code base over that roughly two-week period. The developer community
consists of 610 unique contributors of source code, with $>19,000$ commits
accepted into the code base (GitHub page data).

From the user side, there have been at least 15 million downloads
of the SciPy manylinux wheels between the start of 2016 and May of 2018
(njs blog). The recommended source for citing SciPy is simply a reference
to the website / library itself\cite{SciPylib}, and has been cited $>3000$
times. Some of the most prominent citing articles include the IPython
publication\cite{PER-GRA:2007}, a heavily-cited Nature Biotechnology
article\cite{pmid17287757}, a dark
matter annihilitation study in the field of
cosmology\cite{1475-7516-2012-08-007}, and many of the
other major downstream software libraries in the Python scientific
computing stack.

\textbf{Future development}.
\textit{This section should include key issues: sparse arrays, ndimage pixel vs point, splines, fftpack vs. np.fft and linalg vs. np.linalg, under-maintained submodules.}
