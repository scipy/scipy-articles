# Summary

SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is an open source library for mathematics, science,
and engineering. It includes modules for statistics, optimization and root finding,
fitting,  evaluation of special functions, interpolation, integration, ODE solvers,
Fourier transforms, handling of sparse matrices, linear algebra with dense and
sparse matrices, hierarchial clustering, signal and N-dimensional image processing,
spatial algorithms and data structures, graph algorithms, and reading and
writing data files in a variety of common data formats.

The @SciPy library depends on NumPy [@NumPy, @WCV2011], which provides convenient
and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with
NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical methods such
as routines for numerical integration and optimization. 

The latest stable release of SciPy is [0.18.1](@SciPy0181), which improves on the feature
release [0.18.0](SciPy0180). Together they contain numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage,
better documentation, and many new features. 

Highlights of this release include:

* A new ODE solver for two-point boundary value problems, `scipy.optimize.solve_bvp`.
* A new class, `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline`, for cubic spline interpolation of data.
* N-dimensional tensor product polynomials, `scipy.interpolate.NdPPoly`.
* Spherical Voronoi diagrams, `scipy.spatial.SphericalVoronoi`.
* Support for discrete-time linear systems, `scipy.signal.dlti`.

For the complete description of the contents of the 0.18 series, see the
[release notes](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/releases/tag/v0.18.0).
